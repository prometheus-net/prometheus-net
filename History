- Bugfix: HttpClientMetrics under concurrent load with long-running requests were leading to broken response streams. #336
* 5.0.1

- Added missing UTF-8 charset to Content-Type header, so non-ASCII characters are interpreted correctly by browsers.
* 3.1.0
- Added ICounter.NewTimer() (adds the value to the counter)
- Eliminated some needless allocations when trying to register a metric that is already registered. #134
- Added IHistogram.Count and IHistogram.Sum to expose aspects of collected data for inspection.
- Added Collector.GetAllLabelValues() to expose the list of child metrics by all their known label values.
