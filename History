* 3.1.0
- Added ICounter.NewTimer() (adds the value to the counter)
- Eliminated some needless allocations when trying to register a metric that is already registered. #134
* 3.0.3
- Now backward compatible with ASP.NET Core 2.1 (was 2.2+)
* 3.0.2
- Fix defect where histogram sum failed to increment.
* 3.0.1
- Fix ObjectDisposedException in MetricPusher.
* 3.0.0
- Added HTTP request metrics for ASP.NET Core.
- Somewhat more realistic examples in readme.
- Metrics exporter is now significantly more CPU and memory-efficient.
- Added Observe(value, count) to histogram metric, enabling multiple observations with the same value to be counted.
- Added CountExceptions() and MeasureInProgress() helper extensions.
- Adjusted API to better conform to Prometheus client library guidelines in terms of default values.
- Breaking change: assemblies are now strong-named.
- Breaking change: removed "windows" from built-in metric names as they are not Windows-specific.
- Breaking change: removed support for protobuf export format (it is no longer used by Prometheus).
- Breaking change: API surface cleaned up, removed some legacy methods, made many internal types actually internal.
- Breaking change: "on demand collectors" concept replaced with simpler "before collect callbacks". Works the same, just less code needed to use it and fewer possible error conditions.
- Breaking change: removed support for "custom collectors", as this was a very special use case that did not benefit at all from the main functionality of the library. Just generate a Prometheus exporter output document yourself if you need to export arbitrary data.
* 2.1.3
- Fixed wrong case used for metric type in the export data format. Should always be lowercase. #96
* 2.1.2
- Fixed potential conflict when using pushgateway and also other exporter libraries (see #89)
* 2.1.1
- Various minor fixes (see issues on GitHub for details).
* 2.1.0
- Add MetricOptions and subclasses for more extensible API (old API surface remains available)
- Add SuppressInitialValue to metric configuration (ref https://www.robustperception.io/existential-issues-with-metrics/)
- Add .WithLabels() as alternative to .Labels() for fewer annoying Intellisense conflicts.
* 2.0.0
- Targeting .NET Standard 2.0 as minimum version (.NET Framework 4.6.1, .NET Core 2.0 and Mono 5.4)
- Added ASP.NET Core middlware
- Added possibility to signal a failed scrape from on-demand collectors
- Removed dependency on Reactive Extensions
- Minor breaking changes to API
- Performance improvements for hot-path code
- Removed mostly obsolete PerfCounterCollector class
- Fixed NuGet package contents to remove assemblies from dependencies
- Various minor fixes (see issues on GitHub for details)

* 0.0.8:
- Introduced interfaces for all the metrics to make unlabelled collectors and their children polymorph
* 0.0.7:
- Added the notion of OnDemandCollectors + a DotNetStatsCollector to avoid having to use .net perf counters
