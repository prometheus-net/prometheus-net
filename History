* 3.5.0
- Exposed metric.Unpublish() method since there was already a matching Publish() there.
- When the scrape is aborted, stop collecting/serializing metrics. #189

- Lazy-initialize the default sample metrics to reduce initialization cost for those who do not need them. #170

- Fix DotNetStats occasional data tearing under parallel collections. #173
- Improved wording of some error messages. #169

- Improve .NET Framework 4.6.1 packaging to include the ValueTuple reference automatically. #179
- ASP.NET Core HTTP metrics now capture route data before it is overwritten by an exception handler. #177
- ASP.NET Core HTTP "in progress" metrics now include controller/action labels (ASP.NET Core 3 only).
- Fixed concurrently defect in HTTP metrics that may have caused label values from wrong request to apply. #182
- The HttpListener based MetricServer can now handle more than one concurrent request.
- Added asynchronous "before collect" callbacks, giving user code more flexibility in metric updates.
- Added .Remove() to labeled metric instances for more convenient removal API (previously had to call method on parent instance).
- Added .Unpublish() to labeled metric instances to support temporary unpublishing of a metric, without discarding collected data (e.g. histogram buckets), during periods of data unavailability.
* 3.3.0
- Add ability to filter requests by port number when exporting metrics. #160
* 3.2.1
- Fix NuGet packaging defect that caused reference failures after installing .2.0 on .NET Core 2.1 or newer. #158
* 3.2.0
- Enable custom HTTP client to be used in MetricPusher, allowing for Basic auth and more flexibility. #125
- Add DiagnosticSourceAdapter (.NET Core only). #153
- Improved compatibility with older .NET Framework versions. #155
* 3.1.4
- Fix timezone mismatch in Summary that led to unintended delays in buffer flushing. #149
* 3.1.3
- Fix regression introduced in 3.1.0 where MetricPusher does not always flush metrics before stopping.
* 3.1.2
- Fix defect where Histogram batch observations only incremented sum by one value, instead of entire batch. #147
* 3.1.1
- Added missing UTF-8 charset to Content-Type header, so non-ASCII characters are interpreted correctly by browsers.
* 3.1.0
- Added ICounter.NewTimer() (adds the value to the counter)
- Eliminated some needless allocations when trying to register a metric that is already registered. #134
- Added IHistogram.Count and IHistogram.Sum to expose aspects of collected data for inspection.
- Added Collector.GetAllLabelValues() to expose the list of child metrics by all their known label values.
- Metric export is now asynchronous internally to be compatible with ASP.NET Core 3.0 default configuration.
- Added CollectorRegistry.CollectAndExportAsTextAsync() to support metric data export via arbitrary custom endpoints.
* 3.0.3
- Now backward compatible with ASP.NET Core 2.1 (was 2.2+)
* 3.0.2
- Fix defect where histogram sum failed to increment.
* 3.0.1
- Fix ObjectDisposedException in MetricPusher.
* 3.0.0
- Added HTTP request metrics for ASP.NET Core.
- Somewhat more realistic examples in readme.
- Metrics exporter is now significantly more CPU and memory-efficient.
- Added Observe(value, count) to histogram metric, enabling multiple observations with the same value to be counted.
- Added CountExceptions() and MeasureInProgress() helper extensions.
- Adjusted API to better conform to Prometheus client library guidelines in terms of default values.
- Breaking change: assemblies are now strong-named.
- Breaking change: removed "windows" from built-in metric names as they are not Windows-specific.
- Breaking change: removed support for protobuf export format (it is no longer used by Prometheus).
- Breaking change: API surface cleaned up, removed some legacy methods, made many internal types actually internal.
- Breaking change: "on demand collectors" concept replaced with simpler "before collect callbacks". Works the same, just less code needed to use it and fewer possible error conditions.
- Breaking change: removed support for "custom collectors", as this was a very special use case that did not benefit at all from the main functionality of the library. Just generate a Prometheus exporter output document yourself if you need to export arbitrary data.
* 2.1.3
- Fixed wrong case used for metric type in the export data format. Should always be lowercase. #96

* 2.1.1
- Various minor fixes (see issues on GitHub for details).
* 2.1.0
